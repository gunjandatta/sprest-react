_With the Fabric-UI constantly changing, I'm no longer focused on extending this library and am more focused on the [Bootstrap](https://github.com/gunjandatta/sprest-bs) versions of the library. I recommend looking at the [fabric-ui documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/use-fabric-react-components) for fabric-ui examples._

## SharePoint React Library
This library extends the [Office Fluent-UI React library](https://dev.office.com/fabric), to help create Office 365 components in SharePoint 2013/Online (Classic) environments. Reference the [React library](https://gunjandatta.github.io/extras/react) for information on this library, or [SharePoint REST Framework](https://gunjandatta.github.io) for a full overview of the framework.
